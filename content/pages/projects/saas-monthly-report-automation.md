## Event-Tech Startup — Monthly Report Automation

A rapidly growing SaaS company needed to streamline the process of generating and sending monthly customer reports.

Previously, report preparation and mailing required manual data extraction and formatting.

### Solution

Delivered by **erobot.ai**, the automation:

- Extracts required data automatically on the first day of each month  
- Compiles structured and visually improved reports  
- Sends reports automatically to designated recipients  
- Reduces manual involvement to oversight only  

As part of the project, report structure was optimized to highlight metrics most valuable to customers.

### Impact

- Reports delivered consistently on the first day of the month  
- Faster internal processes  
- Reduced human errors  
- Lower routine workload for staff  
- Improved customer experience
