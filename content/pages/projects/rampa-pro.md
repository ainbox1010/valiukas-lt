## Rampa Pro

Rampa Pro is a smart online system that automates truck entry, parking, and ramp management in secure facilities.

The system integrates Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras, barriers, and digital display boards to eliminate manual intervention and improve operational flow.

### What the system does

- Automatically recognizes truck license plates using ANPR cameras  
- Matches vehicles against expected Bill of Lading (BOL) data  
- Opens entry barriers automatically when data matches  
- Allows manual override when needed  
- Takes photos of each vehicle for security and audit purposes  
- Tracks all truck movements inside the facility  
- Enables operators to assign unloading ramps digitally  
- Displays ramp assignments on digital signage  
- Controls exit using the same system  
- Logs all actions for audit and compliance purposes  

### Impact

- Reduced manual workload at facility gates  
- Improved traffic flow and ramp utilization  
- Enhanced security and audit transparency  
- Real-time visibility into on-site vehicle movements
