## Home Healthcare Provider — Mobile Data Automation

A healthcare provider offering at-home medical services required a reliable way to collect and process patient visit data while minimizing administrative workload and human error.

### Solution

Delivered by **erobot.ai**, the solution included:

- A mobile application for recording patient visit data  
- QR-based identification to ensure accurate patient matching  
- Automated end-of-day data entry into the central system  
- Reduced manual administrative handling  

The QR-based identification helps prevent errors during patient data entry and improves operational reliability.

### Impact

- Significant reduction in routine administrative tasks  
- Lower risk of data entry errors  
- Faster processing of daily visit information  
- Healthcare staff can focus on patient care instead of paperwork
