## Telecom Operator — Equipment Documentation Automation

A large telecommunications operator needed to streamline the transfer of equipment delivery and acceptance certificates between internal systems.

Previously, these documents were transferred manually, creating repetitive workload and risk of human error.

### Solution

Delivered by **erobot.ai**, the automation:

- Transfers the majority of documentation automatically between systems  
- Flags and documents cases requiring review  
- Improves process transparency  
- Enables continuous refinement of internal workflows  

### Impact

- ~80 hours saved per month (and growing)  
- Reduced repetitive manual work  
- Lower risk of data transfer errors  
- Improved supervision and standardization of internal processes  

As business processes are further standardized, time savings are expected to double.
