## FactorySense

FactorySense is a custom-built web application designed to monitor and manage factory operations across multiple zones.

The system tracks sensor data in real time, visualizes key operational metrics, and alerts personnel about anomalies before failures occur.

### Core Capabilities

- Creation of interactive factory maps  
- Zone definition and sensor deployment  
- Monitoring of parameters such as temperature, speed, and other operational indicators  
- Real-time data visualization via dynamic cards and charts  

### Intelligent Alerting

- Configurable threshold limits per sensor  
- Automatic anomaly notifications when limits are exceeded  
- Early warning system to prevent equipment breakdown  

### Impact

- Reduced unplanned downtime  
- Faster response to equipment issues  
- Improved operational efficiency  
- Better decision-making through real-time data visibility  

FactorySense supports efficient factory operations and proactive maintenance management.
