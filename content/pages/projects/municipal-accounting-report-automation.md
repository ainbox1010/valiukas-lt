## Municipal Accounting Report Automation

A large municipality providing centralized accounting services to more than 100 subordinate institutions needed to streamline recurring reporting workflows.

Previously, municipal staff manually generated and distributed multiple accounting reports each week.

### Solution

Delivered by **erobot.ai**, the pilot automation:

- Independently generates four different report types  
- Runs automatically during weekends  
- Distributes reports to institutions and responsible municipal staff  
- Ensures reports are delivered by Monday morning  

### Impact

- ~200 working hours saved per month  
- Reduced repetitive administrative workload  
- More time available for analytical and higher value-added tasks  
- Improved reporting consistency and reliability  

The solution demonstrates how even routine reporting workflows can generate significant efficiency gains when automated.
