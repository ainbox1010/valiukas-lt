## Balloon Live

Balloon Live is a mobile application for Android and iOS that digitizes hot air balloon competitions, transforming how goal declarations, marker drops, and result evaluation are handled.

The app replaces manual, paper-based processes with real-time digital tracking and secure data management.

- GPS-based real-time tracking  
- Optional use of a dedicated tracking device (GPS + barometric measurements)  
- Secure storage of flight data in IGC format  
- Digital signature protection for data integrity  

### Real-Time Efficiency

- Cloud-based real-time transmission of tracking data  
- Immediate access to flight data for judges  
- Reduced post-flight analysis time  
- Elimination of manual SD card data extraction  

### Results

- **Streamlined competition process:** Faster result calculation, fewer administrative tasks, and more focus on flying  
- **Increased accuracy:** Digital tracking and real-time transmission ensure precise action recording and reduce disputes  
- **Reduced debriefing time:** Immediate data availability minimizes lengthy debriefs; judges can review results instantly and pilots avoid long waiting times  

The system revolutionizes the organization and management of hot air balloon competitions.
