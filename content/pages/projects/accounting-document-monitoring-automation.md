## Accounting Firm — Document Monitoring Automation

A fast-growing accounting services firm needed a better way to track whether clients had uploaded required documents.

Clients used shared cloud folders to submit accounting files, but monitoring these folders manually was inefficient and error-prone.

### Solution

Delivered by **erobot.ai**, the automation:

- Monitors client document folders daily  
- Detects newly uploaded documents  
- Notifies responsible staff automatically  
- Sends reminder emails if documents are not submitted by a defined deadline  

The solution integrates multiple cloud ecosystems to ensure seamless data exchange.

### Impact

- Clear time savings  
- Faster document processing  
- Reduced risk of missed submissions  
- Improved customer experience  
- Staff reallocated to higher value-added tasks  

This case demonstrates how even simple workflow automation can significantly improve service efficiency and reliability.
