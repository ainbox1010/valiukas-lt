## Municipal Digitalization: GBV & Disability Services

A regional government sought to modernize how it handles gender-based violence (GBV) reporting and public services for persons with disabilities (PWD).

Previously, many processes were manual, fragmented, and difficult to monitor. Residents had limited visibility into service progress and outcomes.

### Solution

Delivered by **erobot.ai**, the project introduced:

- Digital reporting tools for GBV incidents  
- Service request workflows for disability-related assistance  
- Structured case management with assigned coordinators  
- Public dashboards showing anonymized aggregated progress  
- Systems optimized for varying connectivity and digital literacy levels  

### Impact

- Simplified citizen reporting and access to support  
- Reduced process inefficiencies  
- Improved transparency and accountability  
- Scalable architecture for future expansion or replication  

The system is now in active use and was designed to be modular — enabling additional features or deployment in other municipalities.
