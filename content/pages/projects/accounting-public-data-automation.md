## Accounting Firm — Public Data Collection & Analytics Automation

An outsourcing-based accounting firm needed to streamline the collection and processing of publicly available data used in one of its accounting workflows.

Previously, employees manually retrieved, filtered, and analyzed this data.

- Retrieves filtered data from a public source  
- Processes and structures it automatically

### Impact

- Data retrieval and processing reduced to minutes  
- Significant time savings  
- Improved analytical efficiency  
- Staff reallocated to higher-value advisory tasks  

The solution is intuitive and required no extensive onboarding or manuals for employees.
