## HR Services Company — Document Intake Automation

An international HR services provider needed to automate the intake and processing of high volumes of paper-based documents.

The number of incoming documents was unpredictable, sometimes reaching several hundred per day.

### Solution

Delivered by **erobot.ai**, the system integrates:

- Microsoft Power Automate  
- Microsoft Azure OCR  
- Cognitive Search capabilities  

The workflow is simple:

1. A document is scanned and sent to a designated robot email  
2. The robot reads the document using OCR  
3. Necessary actions are triggered automatically  

### Impact

- Reduced unexpected workload spikes  
- Faster document processing  
- Improved operational stability  
- Lower administrative burden on staff  

This case demonstrates how document intake automation can significantly improve resilience in high-volume environments.
