## Large Capital Municipality — RPA & AI Automation

In collaboration with a major European capital municipality, more than **10 robotic process automation (RPA) systems** were implemented to streamline high-volume administrative workflows.

These processes were previously highly manual and time-intensive.

### Automated Workflows Included

- Automated landowner notifications  
- Multi-system data consolidation  
- Certificate issuance  
- Drafting administrative orders  
- Spatial planning data retrieval  
- School-related notification generation  
- Parking permit validation  
- AI-assisted public procurement reporting  

Some robots operate continuously, others are triggered on demand.

### AI Integration

In selected processes, large language model (LLM) technology is used to interpret extensive unstructured procurement documents and generate structured reports automatically.

### Measurable Impact

- Several thousand administrative hours saved  
- Multiple workflows performing several times faster than manual work  
- One workflow achieved a 60× performance improvement  
- Hundreds of work-hours saved in a single automated process  

### Delivery Approach

The collaboration covered:

- Process identification and prioritization  
- Robot development and deployment  
- Continuous maintenance and iteration  

RPA proved especially effective where legacy systems lacked formal API integrations.
