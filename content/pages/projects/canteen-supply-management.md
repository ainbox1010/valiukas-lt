- Secure supplier invitations (no login required)  
- Online price quote submission  
- Offer comparison and supplier selection  
- Product activation for a defined validity period  
- Automatic removal of expired products  

## Impact

- Reduced manual work and error probability  
- Transparent supplier selection  
- Always up-to-date product catalog  
- Improved purchasing efficiency
