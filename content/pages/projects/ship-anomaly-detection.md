## Ship Anomaly Detection

Advanced maritime traffic intelligence platform for monitoring ship movements and alerting on anomalous events in real time.

The system applies deep learning techniques to analyze standard maritime traffic parameters and detect behavioral irregularities.

### Core Capabilities

- Movement pattern analysis  
- Statistical and deep anomaly detection  
- Real-time behavioral pattern recognition  
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical and real-time data  

### Operational Scenarios

**Shadow Fleet Monitoring**

- Real-time data collection and AI-based analysis  
- Detection of traffic discrepancies  
- Collision-risk assessment  
- Monitoring of activity near subsea cables and critical infrastructure  

**Real-Time Collision Prevention**

- Automated collision risk assessment  
- AI-driven Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) calculations  

### Results (as reported)

- Improved anomaly detection across 3 anomaly types:
  - Vessel trajectory pattern anomalies  
  - Course and heading discrepancies  
  - Irregular speed-change anomalies  
- 35% reduction in manual monitoring needs  
- Incident resolution time reduced by 1 hour on average
