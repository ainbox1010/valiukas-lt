## What I do

- **Workflow automation (internal & external):** automate internal ops and customer request flows.
- **Applied AI systems (not demos):** retrieval-based assistants, document intelligence, and integrations.
- **Voice AI & IVR integration:** integrate existing voice AI solutions into IVR/call flows (telco background).

When regulatory alignment is required, I work with specialist partners.
