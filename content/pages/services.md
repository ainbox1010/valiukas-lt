# Services

I design and deliver AI systems that automate **documents, workflows, and structured conversations**.

Engagements typically begin with a clearly defined scope and can evolve into long-term system ownership and improvement.

---

## 1. Document & Proposal Intelligence

AI systems that extract, normalize, and structure information from:

- Vendor proposals and tenders  
- Contracts and agreements  
- Internal policies and reports  
- Inbound forms and submissions  

Typical outcomes:

- Structured data instead of PDFs  
- Automated comparison and scoring  
- Reduced manual review  
- Faster decision cycles  

These systems are usually built using retrieval-based architectures and integrated directly into operational workflows.

---

## 2. Workflow Automation (Internal & External)

Automation for processes involving people, systems, and decisions.

This includes:

- Internal approvals and document handling  
- Invoice and contract processing  
- Customer or citizen request intake  
- Hybrid B2B / B2C / public-facing workflows  

Typical components:

- AI-assisted classification and routing  
- Integration with existing systems (including Microsoft ecosystems)  
- Defined human override and escalation paths  

The goal is not automation for its own sake, but measurable reduction in friction and manual effort.

---

## 3. Conversational AI & IVR Integration

Design and integration of AI assistants across:

- Web chat interfaces  
- Internal operational assistants  
- Voice bots  
- Existing IVR and telephony infrastructure  

This is particularly relevant when:

- Requests arrive by phone or chat  
- Intake needs to be structured before automation  
- Scale requires consistent first-touch handling  

I focus on integrating AI into existing infrastructure rather than replacing entire systems unnecessarily.

---

## 4. Applied AI Systems (Production-Ready)

I build AI systems that are:

- Constrained by rules and real data  
- Explicit about what they know and don’t know  
- Designed for production environments  

Where appropriate, retrieval-based architectures (RAG) are used to ensure answers remain grounded in curated documents.

Simplicity and control are preferred over complexity and experimentation.

---

## Engagement Model

Most collaborations follow this structure:

### Step 1 — Assessment & Blueprint
A fixed-scope evaluation of:
- Current workflow
- Data sources
- Automation potential
- Technical constraints

Outcome: a practical automation blueprint.

### Step 2 — Implementation Project
Delivery of a defined system:
- Document pipeline  
- Workflow automation  
- Conversational assistant  
- Voice/IVR integration  

Clear scope. Clear limits. Production deployment.

### Step 3 — System Evolution Partnership
Ongoing:
- Refinement and expansion  
- Performance monitoring  
- Feature extension  
- Integration into additional workflows  

This allows AI systems to evolve with operational needs rather than remain static.

---

## Boundaries & Approach

I focus on systems that have a clear operational purpose.

If a request involves automating documents, workflows, or structured conversations, I can evaluate it.

If a project requires regulatory alignment or specialized compliance work, I collaborate with specialist partners as needed.

I do not prioritize generic chatbot deployments without a defined workflow or measurable outcome.

## Start with a Concrete Question

If you are unsure whether your use case fits, ask **AI Me**:

- “Can this workflow be automated?”  
- “Can AI compare these proposals?”  
- “Can voice AI integrate into our IVR?”  

If there is a strong fit, we can move toward a structured assessment.
